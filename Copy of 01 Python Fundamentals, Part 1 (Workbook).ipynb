Create a new Code Cell below the code snippets inside Raw Cells (Insert Cell below then convert the cell type to Code Cell).\n","2. Go to your newly-created Code Cell and re-type what you see in the code snippet (don't copy-paste)\n","3. Execute (and experiment) on the Code Cell.\n","4. Remember to learn by doing (not just by reading or seeing)\n","\n","### For Coders\n","1. If you are not yet familiar with the concept, follow Steps 1\u00262 of the Instructions for Beginners\n","2. If you are already familiar with the concept being presented, convert the Raw Cell into a Code Cell.\n","3. Execute (and experiment) on the Code Cell.\n","4. Learn the \"adjacent concepts\", e.g. read related documentation\n","5. Help your classmates, because teaching is a wonderful way to learn.\n","\n","### For All\n","* Make this your personal notebook.\n","    * Add your own text annotations in Markup Cells.\n","    * Add comments to parts of code that you find difficult to understand\n","    * Breakdown difficult code into several small pieces (maybe, several Code Cells) that are easier to understand"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FdqsuWtge3qw"},"source":["\u003ca id='contents'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VUJp88Kke3qw"},"source":["# TABLE OF CONTENTS"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X1z9vi3re3qw"},"source":["[Terminal Commands and Magic Commands (Optional)](#chapter0)\u003cbr\u003e\n","[Chapter 1 Introduction](#chapter1)\u003cbr\u003e\n","[Chapter 2 Variables, Expressions, and Statements](#chapter2)\u003cbr\u003e\n","[Chapter 3 Conditional Execution](#chapter3)\u003cbr\u003e\n","[Chapter 4 Functions](#chapter4)\u003cbr\u003e\n","[Chapter 5 Iterations](#chapter5)\u003cbr\u003e"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"freOoZQKe3qw"},"source":["\u003ca id='chapter0'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vlq8Y5HXe3qx"},"source":["# Terminal Commands and Magic Commands (Optional)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QlXG9uq6e3qx"},"source":["Below are some useful tools for doing work in Jupyter.
